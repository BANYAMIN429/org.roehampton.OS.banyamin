## 🚀 Project Overview and Goal

This coursework assesses the ability to configure, secure, and evaluate the performance of a Linux operating system.Over seven weeks, this project involves deploying a **headless Linux server** and administering it **remotely via SSH** from a separate workstation.

The primary objectives are to:
* Implement security controls and harden the remote system using command-line tools.
* Develop proficiency in system administration tasks, including process monitoring and configuration
* Critically analyze operating system behavior under different workloads and identify trade-offs between performance and security.

This work aims to develop practical skills in Linux server administration, security hardening, and technical documentation, aligning with professional cloud/DevOps roles.It also addresses the theme of **Sustainability** by focusing on optimised OS configurations to reduce server energy consumption.

## 🛠️ System Architecture

The project utilizes a dual-system architecture Server and Workstation to enforce command-line proficiency.

| System Component | Role and Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Server System** |**Ubuntu Server** (Linux server distribution running headless).Administration is strictly via SSH from the workstation |
| **Workstation System** |**Windows 11 Host Machine** using an SSH client (Option B).Used for remote administration and monitoring. |
| **Hypervisor** | VirtualBox (Virtualisation platform). |
| **Network** | Systems communicate via a network.Firewall rules will control SSH access from the workstation|
