## Project Overview
This technical journal documents the configuration, security hardening, and performance analysis of a Linux server infrastructure. The project involves deploying a headless Linux server, administering it remotely via SSH, and implementing industry-standard security controls including firewalls, key-based authentication, and fail2ban intrusion detection.

**Repository Structure:**
This repository hosts the weekly documentation required for the coursework assessment.
