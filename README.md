## Project Overview

This technical journal documents the configuration, security hardening, and performance analysis of a Linux-based server infrastructure. Over the course of 7 weeks, I will deploy a headless Ubuntu Server, manage it remotely via SSH, and critically evaluate its behavior under various workloads.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in:
**System Administration:** Command-line interface (CLI) management without a GUI.
**Security:** Implementing firewalls, SSH hardening, and access controls.
**Performance Analysis:** Evaluating resource usage (CPU, RAM, I/O) and optimizing system behavior+.

## System Architecture

### Infrastructure Setup
For this project, I have selected a Type-2 Hypervisor deployment strategy:

* **Host System (Workstation):** Windows 10 using [Specify your SSH client, e.g., PowerShell, Putty, or Windows Terminal].
* **Guest System (Server):** Ubuntu Server [Insert Version, e.g., 24.04 LTS] running on VirtualBox.

> **Note:** A detailed System Architecture Diagram illustrating the network connection between my Windows Host and the Ubuntu VM is available in the [Week 1 Entry](./week1.md).

### Distribution Selection
I have selected **Ubuntu Server** for this coursework.
* **Justification:** [Briefly summarize why you chose Ubuntu over Fedora/CentOS.Example: "Ubuntu was selected for its extensive documentation, stability in production environments, and package management efficiency (apt)..."]
